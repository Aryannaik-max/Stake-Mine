## 🐞 Known Issues

- 🚫 **Withdraw Button Logic Bug**:  
  The `Withdraw` button currently shares the same logic as the `Start` button, which causes:
  - The game state to reset (even if the user just wants to withdraw).
  - The staked amount to be decremented immediately upon clicking withdraw.
  
  🛠 **Planned Fix**: Separate the withdraw logic from game initialization. Ensure that withdrawing:
  - Does **not reset** the UI state.
  - Returns the correct staked amount without affecting gameplay stats.
